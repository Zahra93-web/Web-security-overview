    <h2>What is Web Security?</h2>
    <p>Web security refers to the practice of protecting websites, web applications, and online platforms from cyber threats such as hacking, data breaches, and other forms of unauthorized access. Web security is essential for ensuring the privacy and safety of both website owners and users.</p>
</section>

<section id="types-of-security">
    <h2>Types of Web Security</h2>
    <h3>1. SSL/TLS Encryption</h3>
    <p>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are protocols used to encrypt data transmitted between a website and its users, ensuring that sensitive information (like passwords and credit card details) remains secure.</p>

    <h3>2. Authentication and Authorization</h3>
    <p>Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity, while authorization controls what actions a user can perform once logged in. Implementing strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA) is crucial.</p>

    <h3>3. Firewalls</h3>
    <p>A firewall is a system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic. It acts as a barrier to prevent unauthorized access to your website or server.</p>

    <h2>Security Tips for Your Website</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Passwords:</strong> Always use strong, unique passwords for your websiteâ€™s admin panel and encourage users to do the same.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Software Updates:</strong> Ensure that your website platform, plugins, and scripts are up to date to protect against known vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement SSL/TLS:</strong> Secure your website with SSL/TLS encryption to protect sensitive data during transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup Data:</strong> Regularly back up your website and its databases to safeguard against data loss in case of an attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):</strong> Protect your website from attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) by using a WAF.</li>
